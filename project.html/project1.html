                    <br>
                    <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTZJZsgFnT4zllhftV4Q6BzbiaNUbbSPg68Zg&s" alt="Vincent van Gogh’s" height="'200px" width="200px">

                        While Vincent van Gogh’s parents were not too pleased with his choice in career, it was his uncle who initially taught the young artist how to draw and paint. In 1881, he moved back in with his parents and was financially assisted by his brother, Theo, to who he would often write letters, keeping Theo up to date with his artistic endeavors. When it comes to the idea of the “struggling artist”, it is often Van Gogh who comes to many people’s minds. Not only did he struggle with making a living from his art, but struggled with bouts of depression and mental illness his entire life. Yet, despite these challenges, or perhaps because of them, van Gogh left behind a collection of works that remain highly significant up to the present day.

                <h3><u></u>Gustav Klimt </u></h3>
                    <br>
                    <img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180222155857-adele-bloc-bauer-i-by-gustav-klimt.jpg?q=w_1600,h_1625,x_0,y_0,c_fill" alt="Gustav Klimt " height="'200px" width="200px">
                    <p>
                        While Klimt’s paintings were refined and elegant masterpieces, the artist himself was a rather disheveled-looking character known for his eccentric behavior and lifestyle. In fact, he spent much of his time walking around in a smock and was known to be crazy about cats, even using their urine as a fixative for his pigments. He was also known to have many muses and many of the women who feature in his artworks were likewise his lovers. Yet, despite all of these eccentricities, Klimt’s works would grow to become widely recognized and his paintings, such as The Kiss (1908) has been copied and reproduced on countless products and prints. His use of symbolism was regarded as masterful and he was considered a pioneer in the Vienna Secession movement in Austria.

                <h3><u></u>Henri Matisse </u></h3>
                    <br>
                    <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-517318552.jpg" alt=" Henri Matisse" height="'200px" width="200px">
                    <p>
                        started his artistic career without any formal instruction, driven by intuition toward the same type of visual creativity that had been embraced by his modernist contemporaries. However, his works differed from other Modernist movements such as the Cubists. Where their works were all about turning the human figure into sharp edges and angles, Matisse’s work embraced flowing curves. The De Stijl artists sought geometry in their works, whereas his works were all about bursts of color pigment over the canvas. His works were so untamed, that the famous painter was referred to as one of the “Wild Beasts” along with other famous artists who were part of the Fauvism movement. This movement only thrived for a few short years before most of its artists moved on to work in the Cubist style.
